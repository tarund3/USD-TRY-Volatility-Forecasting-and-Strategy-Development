# USD/TRY Volatility Forecasting and Strategy Development

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook developed for **volatility forecasting and trading strategy development** for the USD/TRY currency pair. The notebook aims to analyze historical data, model volatility, and create a trading strategy based on predictions.

## Contents

- **`USD_TRY_Volatility_Forecasting_and_Strategy_Development.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook with code, analysis, and visualizations related to volatility forecasting and trading strategies for USD/TRY.
- **Data Sources**: The notebook utilizes historical data for USD/TRY currency exchange rates. If data is not included in the repository, it should be fetched from a reliable financial data provider.
- **Visualizations & Results**: Includes plots and charts visualizing trends, volatility, and the performance of the trading strategies.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following Python packages:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn`: For visualizing the data.
- `scipy`: For statistical modeling and forecasting.
- `sklearn`: For machine learning-based modeling (if applicable).

Install these packages using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn
```

## Running the Notebook

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/USD_TRY_Volatility_Forecasting.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the directory**:
    ```bash
    cd USD_TRY_Volatility_Forecasting
    ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. Open `USD_TRY_Volatility_Forecasting_and_Strategy_Development.ipynb` in your browser and execute the cells sequentially.

## Project Overview

The project implements a strategy to forecast volatility for the USD/TRY currency pair and develop trading strategies. It leverages techniques for data analysis, visualization, predictive modeling, and backtesting.

### Key Features

- **Data Analysis**: Exploration and preprocessing of historical forex data for USD/TRY.
- **Volatility Forecasting**: Applying statistical models to predict market volatility.
- **Trading Strategy Development**: Developing and backtesting trading strategies based on the volatility forecasts.
- **Visualizations**: Presenting data trends and results using clear and informative visualizations.

## Usage

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understand market behavior, price fluctuations, and volatility patterns.
- **Backtesting Strategies**: Evaluate the performance of different trading strategies on historical data.
- **Modeling & Prediction**: Build and test models for volatility forecasting and strategy optimization.

## Results

The notebook concludes with the results of backtesting the trading strategy, including performance metrics and visualizations of trades. These results can be further analyzed to improve the strategy.
